## copy mode search

```
If you're using vi key bindings (Ctrl-b:set-window-option -g mode-keys vi), 
press / then type the string to search for and press Enter. 
Press n to search for the same string again. 
Press Shift-n for reverse search as in emacs mode. 
Press q twice to exit copy mode. 
You can use ? to search in the reverse direction.
```

### find-window

If you want to switch to a window based on something displayed in it (this also includes window names and titles but not history), (starting with more than one window open) press Ctrl-b f then type the string to search for and press Enter. You will be switched to a window containing that text if it's found. If more than one window matches, you'll see a list to select from.
