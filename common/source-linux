Installing the Required Software
install the basic software you'll need to compile from source, like the GCC compile and other utilities
sudo apt-get install autoconf
sudo apt-get install build-essential build-dep
Installing from source with build-dep
1. uncomment the deb-src listings in /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
2. use apt to install the necessary dependencies for Audacity
sudo apt-get build-dep audacity
3. download the source package
sudo apt-get source audacity
4. ./configure && make && sudo make install
5. if the installation fails, might have to revert to using the dpkg tool
sudo dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -us
